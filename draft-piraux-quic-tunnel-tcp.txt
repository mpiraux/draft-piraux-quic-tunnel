1.  Introduction

   The recently proposed QUIC tunnel protocol ([I-D.piraux-quic-tunnel])
   allows conveying several Internet protocols inside a QUIC connection.
   Its first operating mode, the datagram mode, proposes to transport
   plain IP packets inside QUIC packets.  Its main advantage is that it
   supports IP and any protocol above the network layer.  However, this
   advantage comes with a large per-packet overhead since each packet
   contains both a network and a transport header.  All these headers
   must be transmitted in addition with the IP/UDP/QUIC headers of the

   QUIC connection.  For TCP connections for instance, the per-packet
   overhead can be large.

   In this document, we propose a new operating mode for the QUIC tunnel
   protocol, called the stream mode.  It takes advantage of the QUIC
   streams to transport TCP bytestreams over a QUIC connection.
   Furthermore, we define methods for grouping QUIC tunnel connections
   and steering TCP flows from one to another.

   Section 3 describes this new mode.  Section 6 specifies the format of
   the messages introduced by this document.  Section 7 contains example
   flows.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The stream mode

   Since QUIC supports multiple streams, another possibility to carry
   the data exchanged over TCP connections between the client and the
   concentrator is to transport the bytestream of each TCP connection as
   one of the bidirectional streams of the QUIC connection.  For this,
   we base our approach on the 0-RTT Converter protocol
   [I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters] that was proposed to ease the deployment
   of TCP extensions.  In a nutshell, it is an application proxy that
   converts TCP connections, allowing the use of new TCP extensions
   through an intermediate relay.

   We use a similar approach in our stream mode.  When a client opens a
   stream, it sends at the beginning of the bytestream one or more TLV
   messages indicating the IP address and port number of the remote
   destination of the bytestream.  Their format is detailed in section
   Section 6.1.  Upon reception of such a TLV message, the concentrator
   opens a TCP connection towards the specified destination and connects
   the incoming bytestream of the QUIC connection to the bytestream of
   the new TCP connection (and similarly in the opposite direction).

   Figure 1 summarizes how the new TCP connection is mapped to the QUIC
   stream.  Actions and events of a TCP connection are translated to
   action and events of a QUIC stream, so that a state transition of one
   is translated to the other.

   | Stream opened, TLVs received  | Send SYN   |
   | Stream FIN received           | Send FIN   |
   | STOP_SENDING received         | Send RST   |
   | RESET_STREAM received         | Send RST   |
   | Stream data received          | Send data  |
   +-------------------------------+------------+

              Figure 1: TCP connection to QUIC stream mapping

   When sending STOP_SENDING or RESET_STREAM frames in response to the
   receipt of a TCP RST, QUIC tunnel peers MUST use the application
   protocol error code 0x00 (TCP_CONNECTION_RESET).

   The QUIC stream-level flow control can be tuned to match the receive
   window size of the corresponding TCP, so that no excessive data needs
   to be buffered.

   In order to take advantage of the several access networks to which
   the client is connected, we define a way of grouping the QUIC
   connections in a single tunneling session.  This allows steering the
   TCP flows mapped to a QUIC stream of a given connection to another
   QUIC stream of another QUIC connection in the tunneling session.  For
   that purpose, the concentrator sends a token that identifies the
   tunneling session after the QUIC connection has been established.
   The client has then the opportunity of opening new QUIC connections
   and join them to the tunneling session.  The messages exchanged for
   this mechanism are described in Section 6.2.

4.  Connection establishment

   During the connection establishment, the concentrator can control the
   number of connections bytestreams that can be opened initially by
   setting the initial_max_streams_bidi QUIC transport parameter as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].

5.  Joining a tunneling session

   Joining a tunneling session allows pausing and resuming tunneled
   bytestreams from one QUIC connection to the other.  The messages used
   for this purpose are described in Section 6.2.  A dedicated
   unidirectional stream is used to convey these messages and establish
   the negotiation of a tunneling session.  This negotiation MUST NOT
   take place more than once per QUIC connection.

6.  Messages format

   In the following sections, we specify the format of each message
   introduced in this document.  They are encoded as TLVs, i.e. (Type,
   Length, Value) tuples, as illustrated in Figure 2.  All TLV fields
   are encoded in network-byte order.

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Type (8)   |   Length (8)  |          [Value (*)]        ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                     Figure 2: QUIC tunnel TLV Format

   The Type field is encoded as a byte and identifies the type of the
   TLV.  The Length field is encoded as a byte and indicate the length
   of the Value field.  A value of zero indicates that no Value field is
   present.  The Value field is a type-specific value whose length is
   determined by the Length field.

6.1.  QUIC tunnel stream TLVs

   When using the stream mode, a one or more messages are used to
   trigger and confirm the establishment of a connection towards the
   final destination for a given stream.  Those messages are exchanged
   on this given QUIC stream before the TCP connection bytestream.  This
   section describes the format of these messages.

   This document specifies the following QUIC tunnel stream TLVs:

   +------+----------+-----------------------------+

                     Figure 3: QUIC tunnel stream TLVs

   The TCP Connect TLV is used to establish a TCP connection through the
   tunnel towards the final destination.  The TCP Extended Connect TLV
   allows indicating more information in the establishment request.  The
   TCP Connect OK TLV confirms the establishment of this TCP connection.
   The TCP Resume Token TLV is used to associate the TCP connection with
   a particular token.  This token can be used to pause and resume its
   associated TCP connection over another QUIC connection part of the
   tunneling session using the TCP Resume TLV.  The Error TLV is used to
   indicate any error that occurred during the TCP connection
   establishment associated to the QUIC stream.  Finally, the End TLV
   marks the end of the series of TLVs and the start of the bytestream
   on a given QUIC stream.  These TLVs are detailed in the following
   sections.

      Offset 0         Offset 4   Offset 6

           Figure 4: Examples of use of QUIC tunnel stream TLVs

   In Figure 4, two examples of use of QUIC tunnel streams TLVs are
   given.  In the first one, the client opens Stream 0 and sends three
   TLVs.  The first one will establish a new TCP connection through the
   tunnel.  This TCP connection will be associated with the Resume Token

   contained in the second TLV.  The third TLV marks the end of the
   series of TLV and the start of the TCP bytestream.

   The second example illustrates how a Resume Token can be used using a
   TCP Resume TLV to resume a TCP connection that was established
   through another QUIC connection part of the tunneling session.

6.1.1.  TCP Connect TLV

   The TCP Connect TLV indicates the final destination of the TCP
   connection associated to a given QUIC stream.  The fields Remote Peer
   Port and Remote Peer IP Address contain the destination port number
   and IP address of the final destination.

   The Remote Peer IP Address MUST be encoded as an IPv6 address.  IPv4
   addresses MUST be encoded using the IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address format
   defined in [RFC4291].  Further, the Remote Peer IP address field MUST
   NOT include multicast, broadcast, and host loopback addresses
   [RFC6890].

   A QUIC tunnel peer MUST NOT send more than one TCP Connect TLV per
   QUIC stream.  A QUIC tunnel peer MUST NOT send a TCP Connect TLV if a
   TCP Extended Connect TLV or a TCP Resume TLV was previously sent on a
   given stream.  A QUIC tunnel peer MUST NOT send a TCP Connect TLV on
   non-self initiated streams.

   The TCP Extended Connect TLV is an extended version of the TCP
   Connect TLV.  It also indicates the source of the TCP connection.
   The fields Remote Peer Port and Remote Peer IP Address contain the
   destination port number and IP address of the final destination.  The
   fields Local Peer Port and Local Peer IP Address contain the source
   port number and IP address of the source of the TCP connection.

6.1.3.  TCP Connect OK TLV

   The TCP Connect OK TLV does not contain a value.  Its presence
   confirms the successful establishment of connection to the final
   destination.  This message is sent both for new connection
   establishment, as result of the receipt of a TCP Connect (Extended)
   TLV, and for connection resumption, as a result of the receipt of a
   TCP Resume TLV.  A QUIC peer MUST NOT send a TCP Connect OK TLV on
   self-initiated streams.

6.1.4.  TCP Resume Token TLV

   The TCP Resume Token TLV contains an opaque value that identifies
   this bytestream across the tunneling session.  The semantic scope of
   this value is limited by the peer that sent it.  As a result, both

   peers can use the same value to identify two different bytestreams.
   Each TCP Resume Token TLV sent MUST contain a value that is unique in
   that scope.

   A QUIC tunnel peer MUST NOT send more than one TCP Resume Token TLV
   per QUIC stream.  A QUIC tunnel peer MUST NOT send a TCP Resume Token
   TLV if a TCP Resume TLV was previously sent on a given stream.  A

6.1.5.  TCP Resume TLV

   The TCP Resume TLV contains two values.  The Resume Token identifies
   a TCP connection previously established in the tunneling session.
   The Bytestream Offset indicates the offset in the TCP bytestream at
   which this QUIC stream will resume.  Thus, the offset in the TCP
   bytestream of the first byte after the End TLV is indicated by this
   value.

   When pausing and resuming a TCP connection, a QUIC tunnel peer MUST
   resume its bytestream at an offset that does not introduce a gap in
   the bytestream.  The peer SHOULD track the parts of the bytestream
   that were successfully received to resume it at an efficient offset.

   QUIC stream.  A QUIC tunnel peer MUST NOT send a TCP Resume TLV if a
   TCP Connect TLV or a TCP Connect Extended TLV was previously sent on
   a given stream.  A QUIC tunnel peer MUST NOT send a TCP Resume TLV on
   non-self initiated streams.

   A QUIC tunnel peer receiving a TCP Resume TLV with an unknown Resume
   Token MUST send an Error TLV with the code 0x5 (Unknown Token) and
   close the QUIC stream.

6.1.6.  Error TLV

   The Error TLV indicates out-of-band errors that occurred during the
   establishment of the connection to the final destination.  These
   errors can be ICMP Destination Unreachable messages for instance.  In
   this case the ICMP packet received by the concentrator is copied
   inside the Error Payload field.

   o  Protocol Violation (0x0): A general error code for all non-
      conforming behaviors encountered.  A QUIC tunnel peer SHOULD use a
      more specific error code when possible.

   o  ICMP Packet Received (0x1): This code indicates that the
      concentrator received an ICMP packet while trying to create the
      associated TCP connection.  The Error Payload contains the packet.

   o  Malformed TLV (0x2): This code indicates that a received TLV was
      not successfully parsed or formed.  A peer receiving a Connect TLV

      with an invalid IP address MUST send an Error TLV with this error
      code.

   o  Network Failure (0x3): This codes indicates that a network failure
      prevented the establishment of the connection.

   o  Token Already Used (0x4): A TCP Resume Token TLV was received with
      a token that has already been used.

   o  Unknown Token (0x5): A TCP Resume TLV was received with an unknown
      token.

   After sending one or more Error TLVs, the sender MUST send an End TLV
   and terminate the stream, i.e. set the FIN bit after the End TLV.

6.1.7.  End TLV

   The End TLV does not contain a value.  Its existence signals the end
   of the series of TLVs.  The next byte in the QUIC stream after this
   TLV is the start of the tunneled bytestream.

6.2.  QUIC tunnel control TLVs

   In order to negotiate the tunneling session used with the
   concentrator, the client and the concentrator open their first
   unidirectional stream (i.e. stream 2 and 3), named afterwards as QUIC
   tunnel control stream.  The client MAY either start a new session or
   join an existing session.

   This document specifies the following QUIC tunnel control TLVs:

   +------+----------+--------------+------------------+
   | Type |     Size |       Sender | Name             |
   +------+----------+--------------+------------------+
   | 0x00 |  2 bytes |       Client | New Session TLV  |
   | 0x01 | Variable | Concentrator | Session ID TLV   |
   | 0x02 | Variable |       Client | Join Session TLV |
   +------+----------+--------------+------------------+

                    Figure 11: QUIC tunnel control TLVs

   The New Session TLV is used by the client to initiate a new tunneling
   session.  The Session ID TLV is used by the concentrator to
   communicate to the client the Session ID identifying this tunneling
   session.  The Join Session TLV is used to join a given tunneling
   session, identified by a Session ID.  All QUIC tunnel control TLVs
   MUST NOT be sent on other streams than the QUIC tunnel control
   streams.

6.2.1.  New Session TLV

   The New Session TLV does not contain a value.  It initiates a new
   tunneling session at the concentrator.  The concentrator MUST send a
   Session ID TLV in response, with the Session ID corresponding to the
   tunneling session created.  After sending a New Session TLV, the
   client MUST close the QUIC tunnel control stream.

   The concentrator MUST NOT send New Session TLVs.

6.2.2.  Session ID TLV

                        1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                         Figure 12: Session ID TLV

   The Session ID TLV contains an opaque value that identifies the
   current tunneling session.  It can be used by the client in
   subsequent QUIC connections to join them to this tunneling session.
   The concentrator MUST send a Session ID TLV in response of a New
   Session TLV, with the Session ID corresponding to the tunneling
   session created.

   The client MUST NOT send a Session ID TLV.  The concentrator MUST
   close the QUIC tunnel control stream after sending a Session ID TLV.

6.2.3.  Join Session TLV

                        1                   2                   3

                        Figure 13: Join Session TLV

   The Join Session TLV contains an opaque value that identifies a
   tunneling session to join.  The client can send a Join Session TLV to
   join the QUIC connection to a particular tunneling session.  The
   tunneling session is identified by the Session ID.  After sending a
   Join Session TLV, the client MUST close the QUIC tunnel control
   stream.

Internet-Draft             QUIC Tunnel for TCP             February 2020


   The concentrator MUST NOT send Join Session TLVs.  After receiving a
   Join Session TLV, the concentrator MUST use the Session ID to join
   this QUIC connection to the tunneling session.  Joining the tunneling
   session implies merging the state of this QUIC tunnel connection to
   the session, e.g. the Resume Tokens exchanged.  A successful joining
   of connection is indicated by the closure of the QUIC tunnel control
   stream of the concentrator.

   In cases of failure when joining a tunneling session, the
   concentrator MUST send a RESET_STREAM with an application error code
   discerning the cause of the failure.  The possible codes are listed
   below:

   o  UNKNOWN_ERROR (0x0): An unknown error occurred when joining the
      tunneling session.  QUIC tunnel peers SHOULD use more specific
      error codes when applicable.

   o  UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID (0x1): The Session ID used in the Join Session
      TLV is not a valid ID.  It was not issued in a Session ID TLV or
      refers to an expired tunneling session.

   o  CONFLICTING_STATE (0x2): The current state of the QUIC tunnel
      connection could not be merged with the tunneling session.  For
      instance, Resume Tokens with identical values have already been
      exchanged.

7.  Example flows

   This section illustrates the different messages described previously
   and how they are used in a QUIC tunnel connection.  For QUIC STREAM
   frames, we use the following syntax: STREAM[ID, Stream Data [, FIN]].
   The first element is the Stream ID, the second is the Stream Data
   contained in the frame and the last one is optional and indicates
   that the FIN bit is set.

      --- QUIC connection

                Figure 14: Example flow for the stream mode

   On Figure 14, the Client is initiating a TCP connection in stream
   mode to the Final Destination.  A request and a response are
   exchanged, then the connection is torn down gracefully.  A remote-
   initiated connection accepted by the concentrator on behalf of the
   client would have the order and the direction of all messages
   reversed.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Denial of Service

   There is a risk of an amplification attack when the Concentrator
   sends a TCP SYN in response of a TCP Connect TLV.  When a TCP SYN is
   larger than the client request, the Concentrator amplifies the client
   traffic.  To mitigate such attacks, the Concentrator SHOULD rate
   limit the number of pending TCP Connect from a given client.
